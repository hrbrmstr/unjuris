Description: The jurisprudence database is intended to be a single source of the human rights recommendations 
    and findings issued by all above committees in their work on individual cases. It enables the general 
    public, governments, civil society organizations, United Nations partners and international regional
    mechanisms to research the vast body of legal interpretation of international human rights law as 
    it has evolved over the past years. Tools are provided to search and retrieve search results from
    the datbase.
